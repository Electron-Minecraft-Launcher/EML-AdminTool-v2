## How to upgrade

### First-time setup

Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool-v2/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install EML AdminTool for the first time.

### Upgrading from a previous version

Make sure that Docker is installed on your server, and the default Docker socket is available at `/var/run/docker.sock`.

> [!WARNING]
> This update requires to manually add a file to your installation.

1. Connect to your server via SSH and navigate to the EML AdminTool compose file (usually located at `~/.eml/admintool/docker-compose.prod.yml`).
2. Create a file named `.env` and add the following content:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   ORIGIN=https://YOUR_DOMAIN
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080,http://YOUR_DOMAIN,https://YOUR_DOMAIN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with the actual domain or IP address (and port) where your EML AdminTool is hosted. Make sure to include the correct protocol (`http` or `https`).
   Save and close the file.
3. Log in to EML AdminTool as administrator.
4. Click on the "Settings" tab.
5. Scroll down to the "Update" section.
6. Click on the "Update" button and wait for the update to complete.

Please note that EML AdminTool will not be available during the update process. We recommend that you perform the update during off-peak hours to minimize disruption to your users.
